1g15h4z,Zudio Perfume Review,"Got this perfume when i walked into a zudio store randomly a few months ago. I would wear it sparingly but today, my sister used it in the morning around 11AM. It's almost 3PM now and the scent still smells soooo fresh on her. She just walked into my room and I asked her if she's used it again but she hasn't. 

This smells fresh, has a bubblegum scent to it and smells kinda sweet. More like a daytime fragrance and a decent performance from a cheapy is kinda surprising. This was just priced @299 for 100ML and I think it's worth the money.

P.S. - My sister was indoors all the time so no idea how it performs when you go out. If anybody has used this - pls let me know. ",52,https://i.redd.it/5go0h9w9e3ud1.jpeg,26,1728637324

There was literally no difference in the dry-down; it just had a slightly synthetic note which a novice nose would never notice.

Tried asking one guy near the billing section for a carry bag.... he straight-up ignored me like I was invisible, and when I asked again politely, he responded rudely and made it seem like I was bothering him. The billing process itself was unnecessarily slow, like he was deliberately taking his sweet time.

Worst part? A couple of the male staff members were literally eve-teasing some women in the store. Absolutely disgusting and unprofessional. I‚Äôm shocked this kind of behavior is happening so openly in a retail outlet.

1kc0wtf,Why don't Zudio provide bill?,"
I recently accompanied my cousin to a store to help him purchase some clothes. After the cashier finished processing the items, he asked me for my mobile number. I politely declined, but he insisted that they couldn‚Äôt issue a bill without it, claiming they no longer provide hard copies and only send digital receipts via SMS.

This struck me as concerning. Isn‚Äôt it a violation of consumer rights to make a mobile number mandatory for issuing a bill? Providing a bill is a legal requirement for every purchase, and withholding one due to refusal to share personal information seems contradictory and potentially unlawful.

What recourse do consumers have in such situations, and how can this kind of practice be addressed or reported?

TL;DR: A store refused to issue a bill unless I provided my mobile number, claiming receipts are only sent via SMS. This seems like a violation of consumer rights, as providing a bill is legally required. What can consumers do in such cases?

Edit: I have lodged a complaint with National Consumer Helpline website. Let's wait and see what happens. ",167,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskIndia/comments/1kc0wtf/why_dont_zudio_provide_bill/,74,1746076092

It‚Äôs my story‚Äîa reminder that no matter where you start, with patience and persistence, things can change. If you're at the beginning of your career, I hope this gives you a reason to keep going.*

# Background

I come from a low-income family. My dad earned around ‚Çπ7‚Äì8K/month, my mom maybe ‚Çπ5‚Äì7K (never asked, never dared). Money was always tight, but I somehow ended up in a decent private school‚Äî‚Çπ1,200/month fee when I left. Miracles happen.

I was smart, but also profoundly lazy. Scored 89% in both 10th and 12th with minimal studying and maximum cricket.

I bombed JEE (no coaching, no idea what I was doing) and joined a local private engineering college. The main reason? The college bus started from my area, so guaranteed window seat for four years. Priorities, right?

College fees were hard to afford, loans were rejected, but relatives stepped in and helped. We made it through.

# College Life

I took ECE and immediately started building electronics projects just for fun. It was less about grades and more about messing around with bots and components. I coasted at an 8 CGPA with minimal effort.

By third year, I realized I enjoyed programming more than anything else. Electronics slowly took a backseat, and I dove into writing code.

Final year came, and a known service-based company visited our campus. Out of 400+ students, 35 were selected. Somehow, I was one of them. That‚Äôs when things started rolling.

# First Job ‚Äì ‚Çπ2.4 LPA & Bangalore Blues

I graduated in 2018 and joined the company. The salary was ‚Çπ2.4 LPA. Yes, that‚Äôs ‚Çπ15K a month. And yes, in Bangalore.

I was terrified. How do you survive in a city like Bangalore with that kind of salary? Turns out, a 3-sharing PG with friends and a talent for stretching ‚Çπ500 like it‚Äôs ‚Çπ5,000 can go a long way. We even had fun. Tons of it.

Worked six days a week, saved ‚Çπ2K/month (I know, financial wizardry). Got into a solid project, learned a lot, met amazing seniors, and a few who probably thought Ctrl+C/V was coding.

After 1.5 years, I felt I was ready for the next step.

# Almost Made It ‚Äì Then COVID Said Nope

By early 2020, I had cleared all interview rounds with a Big 4 company. The offer was for ‚Çπ6‚Äì8 LPA. I was pumped.

Then COVID hit. Lockdown began. The company ghosted me harder than my crushes in high school. No email. No call. Just... vanished.

I sulked, then kept applying.

# April 2021 ‚Äì The Big Jump (a.k.a. The Toilet Call)

One fine day, I got a call from HR while I was‚Äîof all places‚Äîin the toilet, doing my business. Naturally, I picked up. It‚Äôs not every day you get a callback from an interview, even if you're multitasking in echo-y acoustics.

I was making ‚Çπ4 LPA at the time and expecting maybe ‚Çπ6 LPA. But the HR (yes, he) casually said, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll pay you much more than that.‚Äù I swear, I almost dropped my phone‚Äîamong other things. It was a ‚Çπ12 LPA offer. My brain short-circuited.

But there was a catch.

He said they could only offer a max 60-day notice period, and I‚Äôd have to convince my employer to release me early. My plan was to resign first and then figure out how to shorten the notice period. Risky move, but what choice did I have?

Turns out, luck was on my side.

Since I was on the bench (client had pulled out) and was about to be assigned to a new project, my manager said, ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre going to leave in 90 days, we‚Äôll just have to find someone else again. Can we release you in 15 days instead?‚Äù

I casually said yes. Internally, I was throwing confetti, doing cartwheels, and moonwalking out of there.

Joined the healthcare startup in April 2021. The work was great. Team was solid. For a while, everything was smooth.

# The Market Run ‚Äì 13 Offers Later

I stayed at the healthcare company for about 1.6 years. But by December 2021, the Great Resignation wave hit us hard. People started leaving in batches. Five out of seven teammates quit. That was my cue.

So I jumped back into interviews‚Äîslowly at first. But once I got into the groove, it became a full-time evening job. By March 2022, I had 13 offers. No kidding. My email looked like a job fair brochure.

Some offers were amazing. Some looked like red flags dipped in glitter. But I eventually went with a reputed product-based company offering ‚Çπ32 LPA. It had the right mix of comp, team culture, and growth potential.

I've been here since 2022, and while my base hasn't changed much, thanks to stock grants, my total comp has grown to around ‚Çπ45‚Äì50 LPA. Stocks really do be stocking.

# Current Lifestyle ‚Äì Simple but Sweet

I live quite simply. Outside of frequent traveling and ordering too much food on Zomato (we all have our vices), I don't really spend much.

I‚Äôve never been materialistic. I still use the Android phone I bought in 2019. My wardrobe mostly consists of free office t-shirts and a couple of Zudio/Westside jeans. And my footwear? ‚Çπ250 shoes‚Äîwith ‚Çπ1,000 shoe soles inside. Gotta protect those knees, not the brand image.

For now, this works. I‚Äôve never felt the urge to chase luxury. Hopefully, by 35‚Äì40, I‚Äôll hit a level of Financial Independence (FI) that allows me to choose peace over paychecks.

# The Financial Journey ‚Äì Mistakes, FDs, and Redemption

When I started working in 2018, I knew nothing about investments. My idea of ‚Äúsaving‚Äù was just leaving money in my salary account. From 2018 to 2020, that‚Äôs where everything sat.

After my first switch in 2020, I finally had savings‚Äîand thanks to the lockdown, no Zomato or trips to spend on. I saved ‚Çπ3‚Äì4 lakhs in a few months.

My first ‚Äúinvestment‚Äù? A monthly payout FD of ‚Çπ3.5 lakhs. Yes, really.

The plan was to keep making these FDs until the interest from them could cover my expenses. I thought I‚Äôd cracked early retirement. Genius, right? (Spoiler: I had not.)

Then I found YouTube finance. Watched a lot of Pranjal Kamra. Got introduced to SIPs, mutual funds, compounding‚Äîbasically the whole adulting starter pack.

In Feb 2021, I began my first SIP‚Äî‚Çπ5K in PPFAS Flexi Cap and ‚Çπ5K in ELSS to save tax. I was skeptical but stuck to it. From 2021 to 2023, returns were negative, and I was... surprisingly okay with it. Cheap units = long-term win.

Now I invest ‚Çπ71K/month via SIPs. My take-home is ‚Çπ1.6L/month. I send money home, pay rent, and yes, spend way too much on Zomato. I travel often too. Expenses feel high, but hey‚ÄîI‚Äôm human. Sometimes, biryani beats budgeting.

That original FD? Converted it into a standard maturity FD. It now serves as my emergency fund.

I also bought term insurance, got ‚Çπ25L health insurance for myself, and added ‚Çπ10L coverage for my parents through my corporate plan.

Only started tracking my net worth in 2023. Watching it grow now feels oddly therapeutic.  
All amounts in lacs.

| Total         |  31.61 | 63.24 | 100.77 |

# What‚Äôs Next?

In the next 1‚Äì2 years, I plan to make another switch‚Äîhopefully my last major one. I don‚Äôt want to work beyond 45. Maybe not even a day beyond if I can help it.

By then, I believe my investments and savings should be enough to cover my expenses. After that, I‚Äôd like to focus on other things‚Äîhealth, travel, hobbies, maybe even helping others who are where I once was.

# Final Thoughts

I‚Äôm not financially free yet‚Äîbut I‚Äôm a whole galaxy away from that window seat bus ride to college.

There were setbacks, there were silly mistakes, there were financial strategies even my future kids will mock me for. But there were also leaps of faith, good humans, and strokes of luck that made it all possible.

If you‚Äôre starting out and feel lost, trust me‚Äîyou don‚Äôt need to have it all figured out. Just keep moving. Be frugal where it matters, splurge where it counts, and never underestimate the power of compounding (financial and career-wise).

And most importantly‚Äîstay humble. Life has a funny way of keeping you grounded. Like your ‚Çπ250 shoes falling apart while your stock portfolio quietly climbs.

Here‚Äôs to the next chapter‚Äîand hopefully, to a peaceful, early-retired version of me laughing at all of this from a hilltop caf√© in Himachal.

I visited Zudio after a long time so this was something new. 

My jaw was on the floor when I saw a mother applying ""try me"" lipstick on her toddler's lips. I stopped her and told - infection, disease kuch bhi ho sakta hai ese lips pe ya face pe mat lagao. Then she wiped it with fingers as if being caught and not because she got concern.

Later, I saw a girl around my age doing full makeup with all the ""try me"" products. 

Then more bunch of ladies were doing full face makeup with ""try me"" products. Applying it on their kids, as well. Their kids also using them on their face and lips like a toy. I wanted to intervene but I thought they won't listen and might start a fight with me. They were giving an aggressive vibe and were loud people. 

So, I just informed a staff but they were not caring much. So, I paid for my stuff and left.

That is when I realised what we are looking for in non-natives. We are not looking for them to be an experts in conversational Kannada. All we look for are small efforts that they put. At times, most of the sentences even we speak has more english words than Kannada in them. 

- Door close madu?
- Car yellide?
- Madiwala ticket kodi
- Lunch ayta?
- Yaava area nimdu?
- MG road barteera?

Even when somebody who cannot speak Kannada put an effort to form such small sentences as above fills our heart.

Then, I moved towards the checkout where they keep the knick-knacks and the perfume display was mostly wiped out. Most of them were assault on my nose and smelled pretty similar, only this one stood out. It‚Äôs a fresh perfume, has a bit of everything, citrus, floral, spices. They‚Äôre selling a 30 ml bottle for ‚Çπ199. While the opening is strong, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs going to last for a long time.

1lq3ice,6-year-old asking for momos‚Ä¶ turned out he was drinking. What is happening?,"I‚Äôm still not okay after what I saw today at Start Bazar, Nigdi (near Zudio).

I was just having momos when this tiny, extremely skinny boy ‚Äî couldn‚Äôt have been more than 6 years old ‚Äî came up to me and softly said,

‚ÄúDidi, momo chahiye.‚Äù

I offered him one from my plate, but he said,

‚ÄúApna chahiye. Naya chahiye.‚Äù
That line just stayed with me. He didn‚Äôt want leftover kindness ‚Äî he wanted his own. So I bought him a half plate of momos.

Then he started pointing at the more expensive ones.
He kept saying, ‚ÄúWoh chahiye.‚Äù
After a bit of convincing, he finally agreed to take the one I offered ‚Äî but he insisted on a parcel.

Just then, the momo stall guy looked at me and said:

‚ÄúAchha kiya paise nahi diye‚Ä¶ ye toh pee jaata.‚Äù
I was confused. ‚ÄúWhat do you mean ‚Äòpee jaata‚Äô? He‚Äôs a kid!‚Äù
The guy just nodded toward the kid‚Äôs jacket pocket.

And when I looked‚Ä¶ I felt numb.
There was a small IB quarter bottle inside.
Yes. That child was carrying alcohol.

He didn‚Äôt want food. He wanted chakna.

I couldn‚Äôt process it. I felt frozen. How is this normal?

I told a police patrol vehicle nearby (Bhakti Shakti chowk). They listened, nodded, and drove off. I don‚Äôt know what they‚Äôll do, if anything. But I haven‚Äôt been able to stop thinking about it.

How did a 6-year-old even get that bottle?
Is someone selling alcohol to kids? Giving it to them on purpose? Using them?

This is beyond heartbreaking ‚Äî it‚Äôs horrifying.

Alcohol can destroy a child‚Äôs brain. His liver. His ability to grow. To think. To live normally.
Even one bottle can do irreversible damage.
And he looked like he hadn‚Äôt eaten for days ‚Äî but he had that in his pocket.

I don‚Äôt know who‚Äôs responsible. But I know this: this should never happen.

Please, if anyone knows what can be done ‚Äî any Pune NGOs, Childline teams, anything ‚Äî please share.

This can‚Äôt be just another sad story. We have to do something.

it's this soft floral scent that legit smells like fresh wedding flowers - those fresh flowers you catch when you walk into the venue. soft, so soft. Also a hint of rajnigandha - not the heavy tuberose, but the real, fresh flower smell. there's this tiny lemony touch that makes it feel really fresh. after a while, it gets this soft, musky undertone that's really nice.

stays on for like 6 hours on me. projection isn't crazy but honestly, i don't mind. oh and it's got a green dot so i think it's vegan? my bf picked it out and he's into it too.

1iemvaa,‚ÄúZudio Perfumes Review: Budget-Friendly Scents with Premium Atomizers!‚Äù,"I recently bought two zudio perfumes for 199 and 299. I think they have the best atomizer in all the budget perfumes. It comes with a pressureized atomizer, and it‚Äôs high time that other budget perfume brands catch up.

Here‚Äôs what I think about each perfume:

Ciao - 199‚Çπ
This perfume smells sweet and fresh with a good cinnamon note. It has a similar scent to Paco Rabanne Invictus and Rasasi Hawas, and it‚Äôs also the budget champion Wild Stone Edge. It gives off a good feeling and stays on your clothes for about 5-6 hours with 10 sprays.

Madrid - 299‚Çπ
This is also a summer perfume with a citrusy note, especially orange. It could be a good office perfume in the budget category because it‚Äôs light and fresh. However, it doesn‚Äôt last long because of the scent profile so, you have to carry a bottle . It stays around 3-4 hours or maybe 5 hours in a close environment. It‚Äôll give you the vibe of Clinique Happy for Men perfume.

I recommend checking out the perfumes at the store next door. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll find two that you love!

1) Travel. While rickshaws now start at Rs.26 working upwards of Rs.4/km, EVs can go as low as Rs.1/km while also being incredibly convenient.

2) Apparel. All brands last 4-5x of unbranded apparels, sometimes lasting decades. 

3) Stay. Your rent increases 8-10% a year, along with inflation, making owning a house an ever-distant dream. Meanwhile the ones who bought a house enjoy value appreciation to offset the inflation while their income increase just counts for that.

**Juice**: I couldn't find the notes anywhere, but nonetheless here is what I felt. The opening of the perfume is quite synthetic, it's fresh, aquatic, and just a bit sweet. It almost resembles a freshly cut watermelon on a tropical beach, slightly sweet and very aquatic. This perfume is very linear so this smell continues throughout the drydown. It is a good non-offensive casual summer fragrance.

**Performance:** This is a bit shocking because I have a few good-performing fragrances in my collection and this cheap perfume gives those expensive ones a run for their money.

Projection: 45 min - 1 hour

Logitivity: 5-6 hours.  (It continues to leave a trail even after the 6-8 hour mark, sometimes)

**Price**: 300Rs 

For some reason, this has a really good atomizer. üòë

  
Overall I was impressed with the value and scent, it's a mass-pleaser and a safe fragrance.

Recommended? No. Although it performs well, there are some perfumes under 500-600 that smell and perform absolutely bonkers. (Review coming soon!)

1exsgpi,Review of Zudio MAN,"Cheap, long lasting and smells very nice.  

I first got the small 9ml from the counter to try and was instantly in love with it. So today i went back to get some more and there wasn‚Äôt any small ones left. (I didn‚Äôt know they came in the 50 ml at first) i was really disappointed, but I went to see what was on the discount section on the first floor and there it was, a whole rack of 50ml bottles üòÇ. I recommend my friends to buy this as i liked it very much so 2 of my friends also got it and they loved it. 

It is slightly alcoholic at first and as it dries down it projects a warm powdery and slightly sweet scent that is very pleasant. It doesn‚Äôt smell like the other cheap ones i got.

I also got 3 compliments from the 9ml bottle. Thats why i decided to buy more. That‚Äôs 2 compliments more than i got form dior sauvageüòÖüòÖ.

Projection is average , so is the longevity. So i would rate it as 
Projection- 7/10
Longevity- 5/10
Complement factor-8/10
Value for money- 10/10
Recommend- 10/10

It‚Äôs cheap but it doesn‚Äôt smell cheap. So i would highly recommend this to everyone. 

This is my first review and I don‚Äôt know how to distinguish the difference scents so i know what I‚Äôm smellingüòÇ. ",26,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1exsgpi,21,1724253887

1f8pl1m,Zudio Franchise Scam (Potential Data Leak),"My brother recently inquired about Zudio franchise by submitting an inquiry on the official website, Zudio.com.

Shortly after his inquiry, he received a call from an unknown person who claimed to be representing Zudio franchise distribution. This individual shared brochures and a form with him via email from the address @zudios-franchise.com.

A quick glance to the email and attached materials and it became clear to me that this was a fraudulent attempt. 

However, what is most concerning is the fact that the scammers had access to my brother's contact information, including his phone number and email address which was shared no where except Zudio's official website. 

This is either a major data breach issue or someone internally is involved in these scam. 

I would suggest all of you to be aware.

4. Stars in Eyes from Miniso - good perfume for 600. Feels fresh - i use it mostly when I'm running errands, or can't decide on anything else. Works well all the time 
5. Zudio man - another synthetic ish but good perfume. Best one from zudio collection. 
6. Skinn Steele - strong, warm, spicy, peppery - feels good in winters or at night time - winter specific perfume 
7. Jaguar pace - fresh perfume, used it for office, finished the bottle now
8. CDNIM - no review needed
9. BDC - i have EDT. Been delaying the thought of buying edp due to the cost. Maybe will buy some day
10. TDH Parfum - I have issues on longevity with the bottle I have. Starts very strongly on citrus notes. Later notes are good but doesn't perform more than 4-5 hrs
11. 1 million elixir - strong, sweet, very specific perfume. I shouldn't have bought this big a bottle - as I very rarely used this one 
13. Nautica Voyage - fresh, smells like watermelon. Longevity issues.

Providing phone number to these businesses is problematic because the phone number is used for marketing purposes and many businesses also sell their database.

1g2qv1b,Zudio Man Intense,"Zudio Man Intense is a one on one clone of Zara Night Pour Homme 2

Both are sweet cardamon heavy scents that are fit for dates or casual outings and they offer similar longevity. 2-3 hours outdoors and indoors. When I say sweet I do not mean your regular vanilla heavy or tonka bean heavy scent. If I am take a guess I would assume that the addition of Cedarwood and Musk gives it a very unique distinctive sweetness that is ver invigorating and you get a lot of cardamom in the opening, although cardamon gets toned down by the end of the first hour, it doesn't truly leave the scent all together. 

Zudio being a little on the synthetic side. 

I was wearing Zara's perfume today when I tried out Zudio Man Intense and almost couldn't tell the difference between the both.

Saw her after 5 years, after last board exam. I was with Arun, she was coming outside of Zudio store in Golghar, she was on small divider crossing the road, and I recognized her immediately, and soon turned back. And, then I was in utter shock, don't know how to feel, for a minute I was numb, saying to slow down the scooty. My, heart was beating very fast and my eyes were moist. My friend was in shock, to see me that state because I had not told to any of my college friend about her, even when they ask. I have kept my life completely private. And, then don't know why, I was laughing the whole way, and my friend said that you want to cry, but you are laughing. And, he was right. As, soon as I came to home. I was crying helplessly, in my room. And, don't know how to feel now. I can't even listen to songs, watch tv, trying to study. Nothing works.

And the funny thing is, in next month a friend's sister is getting married. And, I was hoping to see her there and meet her. But, after today, just a glimpse of her made me shaky and overwhelmed.

1f0s0hi,Where can I source zudio like trendy clothes for men wholesale.,"I have a men's retail clothing shop and Im finding it hard to source trendy clothes similar to that of Zudio / Westside. I usually buy from Wadala, Mumbai but the clothes there are not really trendy or at most, 6 months behind the latest trends.

Would appreciate if anyone knows any trendy cloth manufacturers / traders.

Top Coat: studio west nail love gel finish top coat.
